Hey! My name is Gaspar Rivollier. I'm an Industrial Engineering student close to graduation (projected early 2024) in the Universidad Tecnológica Nacional (UTN)(Buenos Aires).

I have experience working with Low Code Application (LCAP) technologies such as Power Platform (Power Apps and Power Automate), RPA (BluePrism and Power Automate Desktop). My experience has been developed mainly in the manufacturing industry. 

I am mostly focused on process improvement using both data analysis and low code development, for fast and impactful projects. 

I have knowledge about SQL, Python and C# (Specially with Unity). I have worked on personal projects with all of these technologies, which you can find in this repository.
